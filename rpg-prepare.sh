# ------------

# and available packages and their dependencies and then taking a few passes

# See if we need to sync the index before doing anything.

# Dependency Solving
# ------------------
#
# Dependency solving and conflict resolution works in multiple passes
# over the master package list. On each iteration, concrete package versions
# are resolved from the version requirements in the package list. Each resolved
# packages's dependency rules are then added to the master package list. If no
# rules are added to the master package list in an iteration then the solving is
# complete.
