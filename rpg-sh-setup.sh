# Usage Messages, Logging, and Stuff Like That
# --------------------------------------------

# The program name used in usage messages, log output, and other places
# probably. You can set this before sourcing rpg-sh-setup to override
# the default `$(basename $0)` value but it's probably what you want.
: ${PROGNAME:=$(basename $0)}

# The progam's usage message. See the documentation for the `USAGE`
# function for information on setting this and how it plays with the
# other usage related functions.
: ${__USAGE__:='${PROGNAME} <args>'}

# This is the main usage setting thingy. Scripts should start as
# follows to take advantage of it:
#
#     set -e           # always
#     . rpg-sh-setup   # bring in support lib
#
#     ARGV="$@"
#     USAGE '${PROGNAME} <options> ...
#     A short, preferably < 50 char description of the script.
#
#     Options:
#       -b               Booooyaaahhh.'
#
# That will automatically trigger option parsing for a `--help`
# argument and whatnot.
#
# Note that the string passed in is single-quote escape. The string will
# evaluated at help time so you can do wild/expensive interpolations if
# that's your thing.
#
# One more quick usage tip. Some scripts want to show usage when `$@` is
# empty and others don't. These `USAGE` routines default to *not*
# showing the usage message when no arguments were passed. If you want
# to show usage when no arguments are passed, put this immediately
# before setting the `ARGV` variable:
#
#     [ "$*" ] || set -- --help
#     ARGV="$@"
#     USAGE ...
#
# That'll cause empty arg invocations to show the help message.
