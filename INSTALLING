INSTALLING

rpg is installed with a conventional `./configure; make; make install' process.
This document describes where to obtain the latest release and how to customize
the installation for different configurations.

See the HACKING file for information on setting up a temporary working
environment for development or test-driving rpg without modifying your system
directories.

OBTAINING
---------

If you have git, the easiest way to obtain the latest sources is to clone the
repository:

    git clone git://github.com/rtomayko/rpg.git
    cd rpg

Release tarballs are also available from the rpg downloads page:

    http://github.com/rtomayko/rpg/downloads

Start by fetching and extracting the latest rpg release into a temporary
directory, and then switch into it:

    curl -L http://github.com/downloads/rtomayko/rpg/rpg-0.2.0.tar.gz | tar xvzf -
    cd rpg-0.2.0

INSTALLING
----------

To install rpg under the default location (`/usr/local`):

    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

To install rpg into a self-contained directory off your home:

    ./configure --prefix=~/.rpg
    make
    make install

You may need to add <prefix>/bin to your PATH environment variable if it isn't
there already. Add the following to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile to ensure rpg
is available to all new shell sessions:

    PATH="$PATH:<prefix>/bin"

The installation puts files under the bin, libexec, and share/man directories of
the configured <prefix>. See `configure --help' for information on tuning
these default locations.

On FreeBSD, if installing as an unprivileged user, you might receive an error
during `make install` complaining about insufficient permissions for `chown`.
To fix it, configure with `RB_USER_INSTALL=yes` as follows:

    RB_USER_INSTALL=yes ./configure --prefix=... [other options...]
