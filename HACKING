HACKING

This is a quick guide to hacking on the rpg source code.

rpg is really a bunch of separate composeable programs, each in the unix
style of doing one specific thing. Most of these programs are written in
POSIX shell (rpg-*.sh files), a small few are written in Ruby (rpg-*.rb
files). In either case, the programs are built as "rpg-<name>" (i.e.,
without file extension) so that any program may be rewritten in a
different source language and not effect the programs that rely on it.
In the future, some of these may be ported to ANSI C.

Grabbing the code
-----------------

If you haven't already:

    git clone git://github.com/rtomayko/rpg.git
    cd rpg

Working out of a source directory
---------------------------------

There's a special configure option for working out of a source
directory:

    ./configure --development

This generates default config.sh and config.mk files that cause the rpg
programs run out of the current directory to use a temporary work area
(<sourcedir>/work) for keep the database and installing files. Once
`configure --development' is complete, add source dir at the beginning
of your PATH and you should be all set:

    PATH="$(pwd):$PATH"

With the source directory on your PATH, the general workflow is to edit
the "rpg-<name>.sh" and "rpg-<name>.rb" files, then run `make' to build
"rpg-<name>".

Then just execute them:

    make
    rpg --help
    <edit some files>
    make
      [SH] rpg-install             OK
      [SH] rpg-fetch               OK
    rpg-fetch sinatra 0.9.6
    rpg-install sinatra 0.9.6

There's a `make auto' target that sits in a loop and constantly looks
for stuff to rebuild so you don't have to do so manually after every
edit:

    make auto

The way I work is with a screen(1) session horizontally split such that
I have a normal shell prompt up top and a `make auto' session down below
at ~15% height.  Then I have vim going to the left of the terminal so
that I can see the output from `make auto' while I'm editing. The make
targets run syntax checks on the sh and ruby source so this is great for
catching syntax errors early on.

New programs
------------

To add a new program, create a "rpg-<name>.sh" or "rpg-<name>.rb" file
and then open the Makefile and add the filename to the SOURCES and
PROGRAMS variables.  The program will be built like the others the next
time you run `make'.

POSIX shell
-----------

The rpg shell sources should conform to "The Standard" where possible.
Any shell language features, utility programs, or arguments to utility
programs not documented here should be avoided:

http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/contents.html

This isn't really about portability (although that's a nice feature).
The main reason for conforming to the POSIX defined portions of the
shell and tool usage is that it's a well-defined, functional, and fairly
simple subset of the unix/shell universe that's known to work
predictably in a wide-enough range of environments. It just keeps things
simple so they can fit in your head.

POSIX shell and shell utility man pages can be found at man.cx.  It's a
bit easier to read than the opengroup.org documentation for my eyes.
HOWEVER, make sure you're looking at a 1posix section manpage. You can
tell because there'll be "(1posix)" in the URL. Some examples:

    http://man.cx/sh(1posix)
    http://man.cx/sort(1posix)
    http://man.cx/join(1posix)
    http://man.cx/sed(1posix)

Lastly, shell programs should be tested under dash if possible.  This is
the default /bin/sh on recent Debian versions and can be easily
installed on MacOS X using homebrew: `brew install dash'.

POSIX make
----------

The makefile shall remain POSIX so that it works with GNU and BSD makes.

    http://man.cx/make(1posix)

There's no reason to use the advanced features of non-POSIX makes.

Docco-Mentation
---------------

The shell and Ruby sources are commented with Docco
literate-programming-style documentation. If you have Rocco and shocco
installed locally, you can build docs for all source files with:

    make doc

Or for a specific set of files with:

    make rpg-sh-setup.html

These docs are also available on the web at:

    http://rtomayko.github.com/rpg/

For more information on Docco, Rocco, and shocco:

    http://jashkenas.github.com/docco/
    http://rtomayko.github.com/rocco/
    http://rtomayko.github.com/shocco/

Manpages
--------

Each program will eventually have a unix manual page. I plan to write a
tool to generate the initial set from comments at some point in the not
too distant future. For now, try to include any information useful in a
manpage in comments and make sure USAGE messages document all options.

And that should do it.

Have fun!
