# The `rpg-sync` program is responsible for building the remote package
# index and keeping it up to date. The package index is a set of simple text
# files kept under the `RPGINDEX` directory. They include basic information
# on all gems available at [rubygems.org](http://rubygems.org) and are
# optimized for use with utilities like `grep(1)`, `sed(1)`, and `join(1)`.
#
# `rpg-sync` has two modes of operation:
#
#   1. Someone runs `rpg-sync` directly to bring the package index in sync
#      with the remote repository. If the command completes successfully,
#      the index is guaranteed to be up to date with the repository.
#
#   2. Some other rpg program (like `rpg-upgrade` or `rpg-list`) executes
#      `rpg-sync -s` before performing an operation on the index. In this
#      mode, `rpg-sync` attempts to determine if the index is overly stale
#      (based on the `RPGSTALETIME` option) and may or may not perform an
#      sync.
#
# Philosophy on Automatic Index Sync
# ----------------------------------
#
# Generally speaking, rpg's philosophy is that the user should control
# when the package index is synchronized. The primary reason for this is that
# rpg should be *fast* *fast* *fast* -- *fast* like a rocket missile -- unless
# specifically told not to be. Network operations destroy any chance at
# predictable performance.
#
# Rubygems's `gem` command has nearly the opposite philosophy. It tries
# hard to make sure it's working with current data consistent with
# the package repository when performing operations involving remote packages
# (like `gem list --remote`, `gem outdated`, or `gem install`). This has
# obvious benefits: running `gem install foo` is guaranteed to install the
# most recent version of `foo` at the time the command is run. Similarly,
# `gem outdated` is guaranteed to show the most recent package versions
# available. This is convenient behavior because it removes the
# responsibility of managing the package index from the user. The downside
# is wildly unpredictable performance in most commands.
#
# rpg attempts to strike a balance between these two extremes in its default
# configuration and can be customized to get any behavior along the spectrum.
# By default, the package index is automatically synchronized when it's more
# than two weeks old:
#
#     # auto sync the package index when it's more than 14 days old
#     RPGSTALETIME=14d
#
# Setting the stale time to `0`, causes the index to be synchronized before
# performing any operation that involves remote packages. This is closest to
# the `gem` commands behavior:
#
#     # keep the package index in sync
#     RPGSTALETIME=0
#
# Finally, automatic sync can be disabled completely with:
#
#     # never auto sync the package index
#     PGSTALETIME=never
#
# See the stale time code below for more information on acceptable values.

ARGV="$@"
USAGE '${PROGNAME} [-v] [-m <mins>|-d <days>|-s]
Create or sync the remote package index. Maybe.

Options
  -d <days>             Do nothing if db is less than <days> days old
  -m <mins>             Do nothing if db is less than <mins> minutes old
  -s                    Do nothing if db is less than $RPGSTALETIME old
  -F                    Strict failures when package index cannot be updated
  -v                    Write newly available packages to stdout after updating

The -s option is used by various rpg commands when a sync may be
necessary. Its default stale time can be configured by setting the
RPGSTALETIME option in ~/.rpgrc or /etc/rpgrc.'
